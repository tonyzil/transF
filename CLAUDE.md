# transF — notes for Claude sessions

## Environment
- Node lives in-project (machine has no system Node):
  `export PATH="$PWD/.toolchain/node-v22.17.0-darwin-arm64/bin:$PATH"`
- No `gh` CLI, no brew. GitHub pushes use a fine-grained PAT the user mints
  per session and revokes after (needs Contents write; + Pull requests to
  manage PRs). Push auth username must be `tonyzil`, not `x-access-token`.
- Ports 3000 (API/UI), 8545 (chain), 8546 (contract tests). Stop the dev
  stack before `npm run e2e` — it checks and refuses if ports are busy.
- `npm run dev` wipes `data/db.json` and redeploys the local chain.
  Demo users don't survive restarts.
- In the embedded browser pane, click coordinates are in SCREENSHOT space
  (the size line under each screenshot), not viewport space. WebAuthn
  ceremonies never resolve there — use the skip path; test passkeys in a
  real browser.

## Sandbox modes (all driven by .env — gitignored, user holds credentials)
- Monerium: MONERIUM_CLIENT_ID/SECRET → real per-user IBANs on Sepolia
  (chain name must be `sepolia` in sandbox). Deposits need a portal
  "Receive" simulation by the user; `scripts/credit-test.ts <addr> <eur>`
  is the local shortcut.
- Anchor: MG_ANCHOR_DOMAIN=testanchor.stellar.org → cash pickups create
  real SEP-24 withdrawals.
- CCTP: dry-run by default; CCTP_LIVE=1 + funded CCTP_BURNER_KEY executes
  (faucet.circle.com for testnet USDC). Stellar CCTP domain is 27; mint
  recipient AND destinationCaller must be the CctpForwarder.

## Current state (July 2026)
- Repo: github.com/tonyzil/transF (private). PR #1 open:
  feat/passkey-onboarding-destination-send (passkey onboarding wizard,
  destination-first send flow, README rewrite).
- Working: three payout rails (KES cash / SEPA / UPI), Candide Safe
  wallets deployed gasless with EIP-1271 Monerium linking, live anchor
  payouts, e2e green across all rails.
- Known TODOs marked in code: passkey assertion-signature verification
  (server.ts), Monerium webhook signature verification, per-transfer FX
  hedging.

## Roadmap (agreed priority)
0. Payout partners secured (July 2026): **dLocal** (crypto product:
   stablecoin-funded payouts, 60+ markets — UPI/India, M-Pesa/Kenya, PIX/
   LATAM; docs.dlocal.com has a public sandbox) and **Yellow Card** (Africa,
   ~20 markets, settles natively in USDC — no prefunding). Build PayoutRail
   adapters for both; Kenya gets two live options (route to best price).
   Pin down per-corridor: settlement currency, prefunding terms, fees/FX,
   recipient KYC ownership, speeds/caps.
1. Iron (iron.xyz, MoonPay) sandbox → USD/GBP funding adapter. Access is
   request-based; user must request it. EUR stays direct-Monerium.
2. Mony partnership (UPI One World app; replied to user's tweet):
   stablecoin top-up of Mony wallets via our SEPA exit → their Banking
   Circle account. Their inbound is manual screenshot reconciliation —
   pitch = we become their reconciliation/API layer. Bebop RFQ for
   crypto→EURe conversion. Constraints learned: ~2% top-up fee, €25 exit
   fee, low-KYC tier caps; SEPA Instant is EU-mandated since Oct 2025 so
   the "24h" is their internal crediting, not the rail.
3. Base Sepolia deployment of contracts (kill the local-chain asterisk).
4. Passkey-as-Safe-owner (true non-custodial; today passkey is auth only).
Parked deliberately: NEAR Intents (future multi-chain deposits), Metastable
(EURe↔EURC later), Flexa/AMP (no — wrong market, card program beats it).

## Style
- User wants prose without AI-marketing jargon (see README voice: what's
  real vs simulated, specifics over adjectives, shortcuts stated openly).
- Honest assessments valued over cheerleading; say what's mocked.
